Build 0.3.1

- Improved Cooking System (New Station Components i.e: SushiTable, Fridge, IngredientBoxes)
- More Dishes, Extra Chairs and Tables
- Experimental Post-Processing (Palettes, EdgeDetection, Embryr Outline)
- Debug Panel
- Small visual improvements

Changes:
- Registry is now global instead of local.

Notes and TODO: 
- Although, the build should be stable, the gameplay loop isn't properly defined here.
- Engine's custom rendering pipelines such as SDFGI are not used here since they're expensive.
- PathFinding on NPCs should be improved.
